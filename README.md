# Food-Search-App
Its trivago-like webapp for food searches. currently supports only Swiggy, Zomato and Uber Eats.

# Why we need this?
- Most of bechlors/students want to order the food from the website which offer a better deal.
But for that One usually spend atleast 10-20 mins checking prices on multiple apps.

**So Our app saves your time and shows all results in one place.**
- Other problem, which we face while looking for the deal in these food apps, is we have to through multiple steps to find final price for any single dish.

- **For example:** 
  * if you want to check how much "pav bhaji" will cost (including delivery charges and taxes) you on Swiggy.
  * You will first search "pav bhaji" in search bar, it will show you restaurent which provides that dish
  * Then you click on the restaurant then select your dish and then add it your cart.
  * then go to your cart to see "Final price(including delivery charges and taxes)"
These steps are for checking one of the results on one app. Just imagine doing for multiple results and same thing doing on other apps as well. Its very time consuming.

**In our app , you just have to enter your dish name, provide location and tadddaaa!!!! results with final price(including delivery and tax charges) from multiple food apps**
